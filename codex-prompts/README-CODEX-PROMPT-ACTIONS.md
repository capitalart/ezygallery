# ‚úÖ Codex Prompt QA & Handover Protocol (Robbie Mode‚Ñ¢ Standard)

This file defines the **official project-wide QA checklist** and **handover documentation format** required for all Codex-generated tasks, patches, and pull requests across EzyGallery or any future system using Robbie Mode‚Ñ¢.

---

## üß† Purpose

Codex must include this structure as a **QA signoff sheet** and attach it as a `.md` file for every prompt it runs. It is designed for:

- ‚úÖ Human-readable code reviews
- ‚úÖ Automated changelog generation
- ‚úÖ Git history documentation
- ‚úÖ QA auditing and deployment prep

This file is **generic** and must never reference a specific feature.

---

## üîÅ When to Apply

Every Codex prompt **must append this structure** to its `.md` output:
- Whether creating, refactoring, debugging, or optimizing.
- Whether the task affects backend, frontend, devops, or documentation.
- Whether generated by human, AI, or both.
