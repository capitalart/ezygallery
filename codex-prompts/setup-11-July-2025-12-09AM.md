# 01-Initial-Project-Scaffold-Setup-11-July-2025-12-09AM

**System:** EzyGallery.com (Robbie Modeâ„¢ Codex Prompt Framework)  
**Author:** Robbie Custance  
**Goal:** Scaffold a complete, modular Flask project with routes, blueprints, templates, and static structure for EzyGallery.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Description

Bootstrap the EzyGallery project structure with best-practice modular Python/Flask layout, including subfolders for routes, scripts, logs, tests, static assets (css, js, images, icons, fonts), and templates (with subfolders for components, admin, auth, gallery, marketplace).  
Include a virtualenv, requirements.txt, .gitignore, .env, README.md, config.py, modular blueprints for gallery, marketplace, auth, admin, and a base main.html with navigation.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Functional Requirements

- All folders and files as per the provided bash script.
- Modular CSS, JS, and template folders with logical placeholders.
- Fully functional Python virtualenv with Flask installed.
- Each blueprint with at least one working route and placeholder template.
- All requirements frozen to requirements.txt.
- Output clear next steps on completion.
- Project root ready for immediate git commit/init and VSCode development.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Files to Create/Modify

- All files and folders as specified in the setup script:
  - `routes/` (gallery.py, marketplace.py, auth.py, admin.py)
  - `templates/` (main.html, plus subfolders)
  - `static/` (css, js, images, icons, fonts, with modular css)
  - `.gitignore`, `.env`, `README.md`, `config.py`, `requirements.txt`, `ezy.py`

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Logic & Constraints

- Script must be idempotent: safe to re-run without overwriting changes to existing files (unless intended).
- Use only Python 3+ and latest Flask.
- All paths are relative to project root (~/ezygallery).
- Modular structureâ€”no code scaffolding; all files have at least placeholder/working code.
- Document all setup steps at the end of the script output.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ QA Reference

**MANDATORY:**  
Append and complete the QA checklist from `codex-prompts/README-CODEX-PROMPT-ACTIONS.md` at the end of your output.

## ðŸŸ¢ Output Example

## EzyGallery Project Scaffold

- `routes/` (blueprints, working imports/registrations)
- `templates/` (main.html, section placeholders)
- `static/` (css broken into base, layout, theme, components, sidebar, etc)
- Fully working virtualenv and pip requirements.txt
- `.gitignore`, `.env`, `README.md`, `config.py`, `ezy.py` all present and documented
